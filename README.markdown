## Modifying the site

:boom: **[View the live site on the actual interwebs](https://sethherr.github.io/erinrose/)** :grey_exclamation::grey_exclamation::exclamation: :fire:

**Page sections:**

- [_includes/intro.markdown](_includes/intro.markdown) the title and intro text
- [_includes/references.markdown](_includes/references.markdown) are the blockquotes
- [_includes/who_we_are.markdown](_includes/who_we_are.markdown) is the section about who you are and the blocks
  - [assets/erinrose.jpg](assets/erinrose.jpg) is a photo for the **who we are** section
  - Upload additional photos to the [assets folder](/assets) (there's a button when viewing the folder for "upload files")
- [_includes/pricing.markdown](_includes/pricing.markdown) is the pricing section with the table

**Configuration:**

- [_config.yml](_config.yml) contains some configuration items like the title, description and URL of the site (important for googleability)
- [favicon.png](favicon.png) is the little image in the title bar when you're viewing the website. It needs to be a square `.png`
- [thumbnail.jpg](thumbnail.jpg) is the image that will be displayed when you share the site on social media

*You can edit the above pages on GitHub.com! Just click on a file and you should see the edit button (circled in the screenshot below) above the preview of the file (on a non-phone browser). You'll have to be signed in to github and be a "collaborator" on the project.*
